// Legacy script.js - Kept for backward compatibility during migration
// This file will be gradually replaced by modular components

// For now, export the original script.js content
// This allows gradual migration without breaking the application

// Note: The original script.js functionality is being migrated to:
// - src/services/*.js (database operations)
// - src/core/*.js (core functionality)
// - src/components/*.js (UI components)
// - src/utils/*.js (utilities)

// This file serves as a bridge during migration
// Once migration is complete, this file can be removed
